= BlogQL: Simple Blog Server with GraphQL API

This is a learning project; something I started to help me learn React, TypeScript and modern JavaScript.

BlogQL is a simple blog server.
It's really just a learning exercise and an example of a web app implemented as a server and a web-browser client written in TypeScript.
The server provides a GraphQL API, which is used by the client.
I made these choices because I want to learn about how React, GraphQL and TypeScript can work together.

Here are some more details about the technologies in use:

Server

* TypeScript
* Node.JS
* Express
* Apollo GraphQL server
* SQLLite
* Jest

Client

* TypeScript
* React via Create React App
* React Router
* React Bootstrap
* Apollo GraphQL client
* Quill (rich text editor)

Infrastructure

* Github Action triggered by PR update that builds and checks the GraphQL schema via the Apollo Rover CLI.
