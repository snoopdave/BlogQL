= BlogQL: Simple Blog Server with GraphQL API

This is a learning project; something I started to help me learn React, TypeScript and more about GraphQL and Apollo Studio.

Here are some more details about the technologies in use:

Server

* TypeScript
* Node.JS
* Apollo GraphQL server
* Google authentication
* API key authentication
* Express
* SQLite3 and Postgres databases
* Jest tests

Client

* TypeScript
* Node.JS
* Apollo GraphQL client
* React via Create React App
* React Router
* React Bootstrap
* Quill (rich text editor)

Infrastructure

* Github Action triggered by PR update that builds, tests and checks the GraphQL schema via the Apollo Rover CLI.
* Dockerfile for packaging the server 
* Work in progress Helm charts for deploying to Kubernetes
