= BlogQL: Simple Blog Server with GraphQL API

This is a learning project; something I started to help me learn React, TypeScript and modern JavaScript.

BlogQL is a simple blog server.
It's really just a learning exercise and an example of a web app implemented as a server and a web-browser client written in TypeScript.
The server provides a GraphQL API, which is used by the client.
I made these choices because I want to learn how to learn about both modern JavaScript and TypeScript, back-end and front.

Here are some more details about the technologies in use:

Server

* Node.JS
* TypeScript
* Express 
* Apollo GraphQL server
* SQLLite
* Jest

Client

* TypeScript
* React
* React Router
* React Bootstrap
* Apollo GraphQL client
* Quill (rich text editor)
