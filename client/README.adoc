This is the client for BlogQL. It's written in TypeScript and uses React.js.

Use Yarn to build, test and run this client.

== Building the client

Before you can build the client you need to build and run the server because the client build process needs to introspect the server's GraphQL Schema.

    yarn run build

== Testing the client

    yarn run test

== Running the client

BlogQL uses Google Authentication and requires a Google Client ID.
Before running the client app, you must obtain a Client ID and then create a file named `.env` in the `client` directory with that client ID:

Contents of `client/.env`:

    REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=Your Client ID goes here

Run the client like so:

    yarn run start
