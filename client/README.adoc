This is the client for BlogQL. It's written in TypeScript and uses React.js.

Use Yarn to build, test and run this client.

== Building the client

Before you can build the client you need to build and run the server because the client build process needs to introspect the server's GraphQL Schema.

    yarn build

== Testing the client

There are couple of Jest tests that you can run as follows:

    yarn test

There are also some Storybook stories. Launch Storybook like this:

    yarn storybook

== Running the client

BlogQL uses Google Authentication and requires a Google Client ID.
Before building the client app, you must obtain a Client ID and then create a file named `src/googlecid.ts` that exports a const string GOOGLE_SIGNON_CID with that Client ID.
There is an example file `googlecid.example.ts` that shows the format.

Run the client like so:

    yarn start
