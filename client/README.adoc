This is the client for BlogQL. It's written in TypeScript and uses React.js.

Use Yarn to build, test and run this client.

== Building the client

Before you can build the client you need to build and run the server because the client build process needs to introspect the server's GraphQL Schema.

    yarn run build

== Testing the client

    yarn run test

== Running the client

    yarn run start
