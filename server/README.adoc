This is the BlogQL server. It is written in TypeScript and uses Express and the Apollo Server.

== Building server

    yarn install
    yarn run build

== Testing server

    yarn run test

== Running server

You can start the server via `yarn` like so:

    yarn run start

=== Using Apollo schema and usage reporting

If you want to use Apollo Studio features like schema & usage reporting and checks, then you will need to sign up for an account at https://studio.apollographql.com.
Create a new graph of type "Monolith" and you get a set of environment variables, including these:

    APOLLO_KEY
    APOLLO_GRAPH_REF

=== Using a different database

By default, the server will use SQLite3 and stores data in the file `db-test1.db`.
If you want to use a different SQLite3 file, then set `SQLITE_DATA_PATH`.

If you would rather use Postgres then set it up yourself and set these env vars:

    POSTGRES_HOSTNAME
    POSTGRES_DATABASE
    POSTGRES_USERNAME
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD
